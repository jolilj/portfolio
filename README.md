# Portfolio
A portfolio site built using [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [LESS](http://lesscss.org).
## Installation and Usage
All files in <b>src/</b> are compiled and bundled by [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io). Run ```npm start```for production mode bundling the src files into the path specified in ```outputPath``` in ```webpack.config.js```. For development run```npm test``` to launch a server at ```localhost:8080``` using [webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html). The current setup places the bundled files in ```jolilj.github.io/```.
